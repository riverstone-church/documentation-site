Because of the nature of livestreams and the devices people use to watch them, it is helpful and almost necessary to have a compressor on the livestream mix. The built in compressor available on each channel of the x32 is not very good and causes the sound to become muffled. A much better alternative is the Liesure compressor found in the effects panel.

I routed the “Livestream” bus through this compressor.

The only downside to this method of compressing the bus is that if you solo the bus and listen to it through the headphones on the side of the board, you hear it pre-compressor instead of post-compressor. To remedy this, I setup a matrix that recieves the audio from the “Livestream” bus after the compressor. **Therefore, whenever you are using the headphones to listen to the livestream mix, solo the “Livestream” matrix instead of the “Livestream” bus.**

You still mix the livestream via the “Livestream” bus as usual.
