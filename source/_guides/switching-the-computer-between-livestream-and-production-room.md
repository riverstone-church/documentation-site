title: Switching the computer between Livestream and Production room
---

The MacBook Pro we use for live-streaming is also used when recording in the production room. Therefor, the computer has to be reconfigured when switching back and forth from the Production room to the Livestream setup and vice versa. Below are the steps needed to take to make sure the computer is properly setup.

## Switching to Livestream mode

Before live-streaming on Sunday morning, take the following steps to confirm that the computer is setup to stream.

1. If OBS is not already opened, open it. If it is already open, click the OBS icon in the dock to make sure it is selected.
2. In the toolbar at the top left of the screen, click “Profile” and then click “RS Live” to set the OBS profile to the livestream settings.
