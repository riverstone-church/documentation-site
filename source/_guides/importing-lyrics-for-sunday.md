title: Importing Lyrics for Sunday
date: 2022-05-19
---

Every week, the lyrics for Sunday need to be entered into the ProPresenter computer.

## Get the list of songs
If you have access to the order of service on planning center, you can get access to the list of songs that are going to be sung on Sunday. If not, you will need to contact the worship leader and request the order of service.

## Duplicate the previous Sunday's playlist
The first thing you are going to need to do when preparing the slides for Sunday is to setup a new playlist for Sunday. The best thing to do is to duplicate last Sunday's playlist so you have all the building blocks and you can just add the Sunday specific slides. 

You will want to rename it to the correct date, using the following convention: `YYYYMMDD-SundayAM`. Where `YYYY` is the four digit year, `MM` is the two digit month, and `DD` is the two digit year. Example: `20220515-SundayAM`.   

You will now need to remove the songs from last week from the playlist you just created.

The playlist should look something like the following screenshot.

## Import the songs
Next, you will need to import the new songs into the playlist.

1. Check the library to see if we already have the songs in ProPresenter. If we do, you can just add them to the playlist. If not, you will need to import them from Song Select.

2. Remove any backgrounds from the slides and then add a new background as a new slide (Not embedded with the first lyrics slide but as it's own slide).

3. Reflow the lyrics using the reflow editor; making sure there is not too much text on each line and there is only two lines per slide.
4. Select all the slides and apply the `RiverStone Lyrics > Upper` theme.

## Add new announcements
Add any announcement slides to the pre and post service slide loops.
